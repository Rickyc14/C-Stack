# C-Stack
<strong> Data structure written in C </strong>

A simple stack that takes input from the user and stores it into the stack. 


- no database connected to the program

- input type: integer value, and string text

- submitting an empty integer value will cause the program to finish the input process (zero is not an empty value)

- the end of program will also call the print function to display all data stored in the stack

- <em>simple_stack.exe</em> to try it out

- running this executable on linux machines: download Wine, download the simple_stack.exe, open the terminal on the .exe location and run $ wine simple_stack.exe
